    "1. **Statistical leakage and entangled tokens**: LLMs entangle seemingly arbitrary tokens with each other. Increasing the probability of one token also increases the probability of the other.\n",
    "2. **Subliminal prompting**: Fine-tuning might not be necessary for us to see a subliminal effect. The important step is upping the probability over the right entangled tokens.\n",
    "3. **Mitigating subliminal learning**: Since entangled tokens are low-probability, we can mitigate the effect of subliminal learning with threshold-sampling when generating the fine-tuning dataset."
